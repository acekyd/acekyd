We'd be going over using the right status codes, structure of endpoints and much more."

It was a game changer. \nAs we move towards a more AI driven society - with a new AI tool announced every other day, it became important for these tools and models to find a way to connect to existing data sources, platforms and context of our choice as needed. \nIntroducing **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** an open protocol designed to seamlessly integrate AI applications with external data sources and tools. In this talk, we'll explore how MCPs work, are they really worth the hype, how to use them, and use cases with AI Agents. This session will give you the foundation to start plugging AI into everything."
