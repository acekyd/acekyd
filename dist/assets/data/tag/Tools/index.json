This involves a lot of experiences, trying out new stuff and at the same time constantly looking for better alternatives.</p>\n<p>Throughout my adventures, I've had to make choices on tools, technologies and platforms I use to have my ideas come to life. Here they are:</p>\n<h3 id=\"ideation\"><a href=\"#ideation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Ideation</h3>\n<h5 id=\"-todoist\"><a href=\"#-todoist\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>* Todoist</h5>\n<p>Once an idea comes through my mind, no matter how unstructured it is, it usually comes with a default name to call it, this name can be changed later, but it helps me quickly add it to <a href=\"https://todoist.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Todoist</a> as a project to work on with a short description. I used to use Trello for this. Before coming up with <a href=\"https://clean-repos.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CleanRepos</a>, the idea came with a \"Repo Deleter\" tag.</p>\n<h5 id=\"-dropbox-paper\"><a href=\"#-dropbox-paper\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>* Dropbox Paper</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Paper</a> comes in really handy for pretty much everything these days - writing articles and also writing out thoughts. Once I am ready to dive deeper into an idea I have, I open a blank Paper page and start typing how I picture it to work, the flow, technologies and resources I'll need and also a basic idea of what pages should be available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"local-environment\"><a href=\"#local-environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Local Environment</h3>\n<p>For a long time, most of my career actually, I have just preferred to go the easy way out when it comes to setting up my local dev environment. I've tried a lot of tools as needed but I've mostly settled with using a stack. I am currently on Mac so I went with <a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MAMP</a> but now trying out <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Valet</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-control\"><a href=\"#version-control\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Version Control</h3>\n<p>Everybody uses Git... no? I used to use Bitbucket when there were no private repositories on <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a> but now, GitHub for everything. Public and private.</p>\n<h3 id=\"domain-names\"><a href=\"#domain-names\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Domain names</h3>\n<p>For a long time I used <a href=\"https://www.maddogdomains.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Maddogdomains</a> for my domain name management and I still have a couple domains there. But now, I have moved to <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Namecheap</a> and they are my go-to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hosting\"><a href=\"#hosting\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Hosting</h3>\n<p>I don't do much of shared hosting anymore. When I used to, I used <a href=\"https://www.qservers.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">QServers</a> and <a href=\"https://gigalayer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gigalayer</a> for clients. Moved to Azure because of BizSpark benefits but that's exhausted now. I use <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Heroku</a> (free) for my quick deployments and then <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DigitalOcean</a> (paid) when needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"platforms-ive-built-for\"><a href=\"#platforms-ive-built-for\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Platforms I've built for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Web</li>\n<li>Windows</li>\n<li>Android</li>\n<li>iOS</li>\n<li>FirefoxOS</li>\n<li>Windows Phone</li>\n<li>WordPress Plugin</li>\n<li>Browser extension - Chrome &#x26; Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll continue to update these with different sections as I come across them and if you need me to clarify any section especially those not mentioned here, feel free to drop a comment.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Getting started with Laravel Telescope - what can it do for you?","path":"/posts/getting-started-with-laravel-telescope-what-can-it-do-for-you/","date":"21.

This could range from a typo to a forgotten semicolon or an undefined function. But most importantly, you want to have an idea of everything going on in your application, how and when they happen. Having access to this information gives you a lot more control in narrowing down bugs and identifying opportunities to improve your application.</p>\n<p>Laravel Telescope gives you exactly this power. It’s an amazing debugging assistant recently introduced in Laravel, that makes development a breeze with tools that allow you to not only monitor and debug various aspects of your application, but also have access to a wide range of information that you’d normally not have direct access to.</p>\n<p>Laravel Telescope provides insights into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, notifications, cache and a lot more. It also shows how different parts of your application work together. You can find out which pages are working right and which queries were run when a request was made to a certain page.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will be covering the amazing features of Telescope, how to set it up and what it can do for you.</p>\n<p>Read the full article on <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-laravel-telescope-what-can-it-do-for-you-719aaef07941\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LogRocket's Blog here</a></p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
