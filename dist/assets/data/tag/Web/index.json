A common issue however is between deciding to use <code>position:\"fixed\"</code> or <code>position:\"absolute\"</code>. Here's a tip to help with that.</p>\n<p>The <code>position</code> CSS property is used to specify how you want an element to be placed on a web page. There are five possible values, <code>static</code>, <code>relative</code>, <code>sticky</code>, <code>fixed</code> and <code>absolute</code>.</p>\n<p>When trying to decide between <code>absolute</code> and <code>fixed</code> - for a content that should be 'fixed' to a spot, it's important to identify the context we want this element to appear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixed-postioning\"><a href=\"#fixed-postioning\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Fixed Postioning</h2>\n<p>With fixed positioning, the element is always fixed to a location relative to the browser's display or viewport. Like having a navbar always stuck to the bottom or top of the screen. This element is completely removed from the normal flow of the page.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.fixed-item {\n    position:fixed;\n    top:0;\n    right:0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"absolute-positioning\"><a href=\"#absolute-positioning\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Absolute Positioning</h2>\n<p> If we however want it to be 'fixed' to a spot relative to another element or as a child of another element, we go with <code>absolute</code> along with the top, left, right or bottom attributes as needed. This parent element however needs to have position set to <code>relative</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;div class=\"parent-item\">\n    This div element is the parent\n    &#x3C;div class=\"absolute-item\">This div element is set to absolute&#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.parent-item {\n   position: relative;\n}\n\n.absolute-item {\n   position:absolute;\n   top: 10px;\n   left: 10px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p> Are there other things you look out for when trying to choose which positioning property to use? Please share in the comments. Thanks for reading :)</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"My Development Platforms and Tools","path":"/posts/my-development-platforms-and-tools/","date":"7.

This involves a lot of experiences, trying out new stuff and at the same time constantly looking for better alternatives.</p>\n<p>Throughout my adventures, I've had to make choices on tools, technologies and platforms I use to have my ideas come to life. Here they are:</p>\n<h3 id=\"ideation\"><a href=\"#ideation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Ideation</h3>\n<h5 id=\"-todoist\"><a href=\"#-todoist\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>* Todoist</h5>\n<p>Once an idea comes through my mind, no matter how unstructured it is, it usually comes with a default name to call it, this name can be changed later, but it helps me quickly add it to <a href=\"https://todoist.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Todoist</a> as a project to work on with a short description. I used to use Trello for this. Before coming up with <a href=\"https://clean-repos.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CleanRepos</a>, the idea came with a \"Repo Deleter\" tag.</p>\n<h5 id=\"-dropbox-paper\"><a href=\"#-dropbox-paper\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>* Dropbox Paper</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Paper</a> comes in really handy for pretty much everything these days - writing articles and also writing out thoughts. Once I am ready to dive deeper into an idea I have, I open a blank Paper page and start typing how I picture it to work, the flow, technologies and resources I'll need and also a basic idea of what pages should be available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"local-environment\"><a href=\"#local-environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Local Environment</h3>\n<p>For a long time, most of my career actually, I have just preferred to go the easy way out when it comes to setting up my local dev environment. I've tried a lot of tools as needed but I've mostly settled with using a stack. I am currently on Mac so I went with <a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MAMP</a> but now trying out <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Valet</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-control\"><a href=\"#version-control\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Version Control</h3>\n<p>Everybody uses Git... no? I used to use Bitbucket when there were no private repositories on <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a> but now, GitHub for everything. Public and private.</p>\n<h3 id=\"domain-names\"><a href=\"#domain-names\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Domain names</h3>\n<p>For a long time I used <a href=\"https://www.maddogdomains.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Maddogdomains</a> for my domain name management and I still have a couple domains there.

I have had a couple people ask me about this and one too many times these projects elude me at that moment.</p>\n<p>Learning is a lot of fun and I've taken the time out to compile interesting web project ideas for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-guestbook-app\"><a href=\"#1-guestbook-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>1. GuestBook App</h2>\n<p>This is as simple as they come… Building a guestbook app covers the basic operations you'd need in building an app -  CRUD - Create, Read, Update and delete. A guestbook app basically allows you store records of people that visit your site by collecting personal information such as Name, Email, and Comment. What you need is a landing page that displays the records in your database, a form to create new records. You can extend this further to add pages to edit and delete existing records thereby playing around with routing of the desired language or framework. I created a quick boilerplate for this to get you started quick and not get hung up on the html details. Check it out on GitHub – <a href=\"https://github.com/acekyd/guestbook-html-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Guestbook Html Boilerplate</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"2-information-retrieval-system\"><a href=\"#2-information-retrieval-system\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>2. Information Retrieval System</h2>\n<p>This can be very wide or as simple as you imagine it to be. It can go from a Library information system that allows you add records of books to the database, view details of each book, search through book records etc to a connected network of laboratories where you can manage equipment records across laboratories. Another example of this is Scammr which i built while learning Laravel. Let your imagination guide you :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-shopping-cart\"><a href=\"#3-shopping-cart\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>3. Shopping Cart</h2>\n<p>A lot of recent frameworks come with functionalities to easily achieve a basic version of shopping carts, but building one yourself would let you identify and understand various parts of the new language or framework you are checking out. From authentication to session management etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-forum\"><a href=\"#4-forum\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>4. Forum</h2>\n<p>A forum can pass as a basic form of a social platform. Manage usernames, accounts and user related data and profiles. A friend once asked me if he had to create a folder for every user that registers on his site programmatically… So he can have example.com/user :D</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-polling-app\"><a href=\"#5-polling-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>5. Polling App</h2>\n<p>This app should allow people express their opinions through polls/votes. You can allow users sign up to create their own custom polls, restrict voters to only signed in users or seize the opportunity to use social logins such as Twitter or OAuth in your app. Display results of the poll.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bonus\"><a href=\"#bonus\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bonus</h2>\n<p>As a bonus i came across a challenge on the internet - The Fizzbuzz Challenge. Apparently, this is one of the most famous programming challenges and all it needs you to do is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print \"Fizz\", for multiples of 5 print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is rumored that most developers can't actually solve this in their specialized languages. So why don't you give this a shot with as many languages you feel good in.
