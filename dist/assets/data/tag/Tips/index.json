A common issue however is between deciding to use <code>position:\"fixed\"</code> or <code>position:\"absolute\"</code>. Here's a tip to help with that.</p>\n<p>The <code>position</code> CSS property is used to specify how you want an element to be placed on a web page. There are five possible values, <code>static</code>, <code>relative</code>, <code>sticky</code>, <code>fixed</code> and <code>absolute</code>.</p>\n<p>When trying to decide between <code>absolute</code> and <code>fixed</code> - for a content that should be 'fixed' to a spot, it's important to identify the context we want this element to appear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixed-postioning\"><a href=\"#fixed-postioning\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Fixed Postioning</h2>\n<p>With fixed positioning, the element is always fixed to a location relative to the browser's display or viewport. Like having a navbar always stuck to the bottom or top of the screen. This element is completely removed from the normal flow of the page.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.fixed-item {\n    position:fixed;\n    top:0;\n    right:0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"absolute-positioning\"><a href=\"#absolute-positioning\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Absolute Positioning</h2>\n<p> If we however want it to be 'fixed' to a spot relative to another element or as a child of another element, we go with <code>absolute</code> along with the top, left, right or bottom attributes as needed. This parent element however needs to have position set to <code>relative</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;div class=\"parent-item\">\n    This div element is the parent\n    &#x3C;div class=\"absolute-item\">This div element is set to absolute&#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.parent-item {\n   position: relative;\n}\n\n.absolute-item {\n   position:absolute;\n   top: 10px;\n   left: 10px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p> Are there other things you look out for when trying to choose which positioning property to use? Please share in the comments. Thanks for reading :)</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"A short guide to constructive criticism","path":"/posts/a-short-guide-to-constructive-criticism/","date":"11.

For a lot of things, there's always room for improvement, and it's up to people to provide feedback when necessary to help the person in question improve.</p>\n<p>By definition, Constructive criticism is the process of offering valid and well-reasoned opinions about the work of others, usually involving both positive and negative comments, in a friendly manner rather than an oppositional one. - <a href=\"https://www.definitions.net/definition/CONSTRUCTIVE+CRITICISM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Definitions.net</a></p>\n<p>I was at a dinner recently and a couple people were talking about constructive criticism at the end of the table. Their conversation was around criticisms and it was actually the best wordings for thoughts that had been in my head for a long time.</p>\n<p>When criticizing work done, like many things, it's easy for people to say whatever they like and automatically assume it's constructive, these 3 steps will guide you the next time you're about to make a criticism - or shut up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-do-you-understand-what-the-end-goal-is\"><a href=\"#1-do-you-understand-what-the-end-goal-is\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>1. Do you understand what the end goal is?</h3>\n<p>You cannot criticize something if you don't fully understand what the result is supposed to be. You can't be throwing \"I don't know\" around and claim to be providing constructive criticism. If you're certain you understand, then move to the next step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-do-you-understand-what-is-currently-being-done\"><a href=\"#2-do-you-understand-what-is-currently-being-done\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>2. Do you understand what is currently being done?</h3>\n<p>To provide criticism that's worth it, you need to also understand what's currently being done, what the shortcomings are and why it needs to be improved. This helps in clearly highlighting the areas that needs improvements and why they do for better communication.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-understand-and-communicate-the-improvements-that-can-be-made-and-why\"><a href=\"#3-understand-and-communicate-the-improvements-that-can-be-made-and-why\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>3. Understand and communicate the improvements that can be made and why</h3>\n<p>We are at the end now, you've evaluated the entire thing. From understanding where the current solution is lacking, you can present your solutions to the person in question and clearly mention how these steps will be an improvement.</p>\n<p>With your response presented in this manner, the person in question can learn why the decisions and steps they had made were falling short and also get to understand how your suggestions are about to improve their solution.</p>\n<p>If your end goal is truly to improve the solution, then these should come in handy for you.</p>\n<p>Let me know your thoughts or how you have tried to make constructive criticisms.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Basic tips for technical writing","path":"/posts/basic-tips-for-technical-writing/","date":"1.

It has rapidly become a valuable skill at all levels for anyone in a tech related career, developers and even designers.</p>\n<p>I strongly believe everyone regardless of their skill level should embrace the opportunity of writing about what they are learning, opinions and even ideas they might find difficult to implement. It's a great way to not only grow an audience and a network, but also a platform to put yourself out there and showcase your knowledge.</p>\n<p>As you venture into technical writing however, regardless of the complexity of your writing, here are a couple things you should keep in mind and attempt to get used to as much as possible.</p>\n<h5 id=\"capitalizing-brand-names\"><a href=\"#capitalizing-brand-names\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Capitalizing brand names</h5>\n<p>Brands, just as the name implies have a specific way they are to be represented. When making any reference to any product, project or even library that has branded itself in a specific way, it is good practice to name these brands accordingly. Mentioning angularjs, react, twitter, github, nextjs, etc can also get lost in context for some readers. However, naming correctly like AngularJs, React, Twitter, GitHub, NextJS etc have the mentions of these products standing out and readers can easily identify them.</p>\n<h5 id=\"syntax-highlighting-and-formatting-on-code\"><a href=\"#syntax-highlighting-and-formatting-on-code\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Syntax highlighting and formatting on code</h5>\n<p>Code can really get complex or even long at times. Nothing makes it easier for readers than having your code appear like it would when they have it in their editors. It immediately addresses the eye test of whether they are doing it right and at the same time, makes the entire article more comprehensible. Some blogging platforms come with great syntax highlighting for code, but you can also use GitHub Gists when needed or for longer blocks of code.</p>\n<h5 id=\"use-correct-punctuation-as-much-as-possible\"><a href=\"#use-correct-punctuation-as-much-as-possible\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Use correct punctuation as much as possible.</h5>\n<p>This also applies to pretty much any kind of writing. A sentence with wrong punctuations can make it harder to read and understand or even worse, misinterpreted. Colons (:) can be used just before showing a block of code, avoid using periods (.) after exclamations(!) or question marks(?). Not all readers will have English as their first language so it pays to make your writing as clear as possible.</p>\n<h5 id=\"keep-an-end-goal-what-do-you-want-the-audience-to-achieve-at-the-end-of-the-article\"><a href=\"#keep-an-end-goal-what-do-you-want-the-audience-to-achieve-at-the-end-of-the-article\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Keep an end goal, what do you want the audience to achieve at the end of the article</h5>\n<p>Having an end goal in mind keeps you focused on the article. Helps you wean out unnecessary information and keeps the article as specific as possible. As you start out writing an article, identify what you want the readers to take away from the article. Is it better understanding of a new tool, process, or you want them to learn new ways to do a specific thing.</p>\n<h5 id=\"review-your-code-like-a-prospective-reader-before-publishing\"><a href=\"#review-your-code-like-a-prospective-reader-before-publishing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Review your code like a prospective reader before publishing.</h5>\n<p>I strongly believe this is the best way to confirm that the code you have put up in the tutorial is working as it should. While writing, it's easy to omit a line or skip a step or vital function and everything breaks with the reader having no clue how to proceed. Once you believe your article is done, create a new folder and go through the article from the beginning flowing each step to ensure that any reader can do the same.</p>\n<h4 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>As mentioned above, I think everyone can get into technical writing to share what they learn or trying to learn with other people. And like coding in itself, you can only continue to get better at it with practice. I hope these basic tips help you take your technical writing in general to the next level.</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
