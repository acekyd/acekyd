A common issue however is between deciding to use <code>position:\"fixed\"</code> or <code>position:\"absolute\"</code>. Here's a tip to help with that.</p>\n<p>The <code>position</code> CSS property is used to specify how you want an element to be placed on a web page. There are five possible values, <code>static</code>, <code>relative</code>, <code>sticky</code>, <code>fixed</code> and <code>absolute</code>.</p>\n<p>When trying to decide between <code>absolute</code> and <code>fixed</code> - for a content that should be 'fixed' to a spot, it's important to identify the context we want this element to appear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixed-postioning\"><a href=\"#fixed-postioning\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Fixed Postioning</h2>\n<p>With fixed positioning, the element is always fixed to a location relative to the browser's display or viewport. Like having a navbar always stuck to the bottom or top of the screen. This element is completely removed from the normal flow of the page.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.fixed-item {\n    position:fixed;\n    top:0;\n    right:0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"absolute-positioning\"><a href=\"#absolute-positioning\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Absolute Positioning</h2>\n<p> If we however want it to be 'fixed' to a spot relative to another element or as a child of another element, we go with <code>absolute</code> along with the top, left, right or bottom attributes as needed. This parent element however needs to have position set to <code>relative</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;div class=\"parent-item\">\n    This div element is the parent\n    &#x3C;div class=\"absolute-item\">This div element is set to absolute&#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.parent-item {\n   position: relative;\n}\n\n.absolute-item {\n   position:absolute;\n   top: 10px;\n   left: 10px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p> Are there other things you look out for when trying to choose which positioning property to use?

It's the most common type of gradient in web design.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>linear-gradient()</code> has the colors flowing in a straight line - left to right, top to bottom or at any angle you choose. It is however, restricted to a single direction.</p>\n<p>The <code>linear-gradient</code> has a formal syntax it follows</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">linear-gradient(\n    [ &#x3C;angle> | to &#x3C;side-or-corner> ]?,  &#x3C;color-stop> [, &#x3C;color-stop>]+\n  )\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[ &#x3C;angle> | to &#x3C;side-or-corner> ]?</code>: This stands for using either the angle e.g 200deg or choosing to specify a direction for the linear-gradient e.g 'to right'. The <code>?</code> indicates that this is optional.</li>\n<li><code>&#x3C;color-stop> [, &#x3C;color-stop>]+</code>: This stands for the list of colors that should be in the gradient. Can be one or more. This color list accepts all form of color syntax. Can either be named e.g red or HEX e.g '#ff33ee', RGB and HSL. Each color can also be given a specific percentage if you want to have more control of how they are displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"usage\"><a href=\"#usage\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Usage</h2>\n<p>The <code>linear-gradient()</code> is commonly declared as a value of either the <code>background</code> or <code>background-image</code> CSS attribute:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.section {\n    background: linear-gradient(green, #fffe33);\n    background-image: linear-gradient(30deg, green, #fffe33);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"using-with-images\"><a href=\"#using-with-images\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Using with Images</h2>\n<p>The common uses of <code>linear-gradient</code> involve colors but it can certainly be used in more interesting ways. Including with images.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of the <code>background</code> CSS property, a shorthand that sets multiple background related properties all at once e.g background-color, background-image, we'd set the background with a gradient and the other part with background-image.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.gradient {\n    background: linear-gradient(110deg, #E36E55 0%, #D78F52 40%, transparent 0%),\n                url(image.jpg);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's a demo attached from codepen.</p>\n<div class=\"codepen-embed\">\n    <p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\"\n        data-default-tab=\"result,html\" data-user=\"acekyd\" data-slug-hash=\"yxqEWV\" data-preview=\"true\"\n        style=\"height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\"\n        data-pen-title=\"\">\n    </p>\n</div>\n<p>You can get creative with the degrees, directions and also percentage of color and transparency in the `background property to achieve your desired result.</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
