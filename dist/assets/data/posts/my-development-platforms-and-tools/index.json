This involves a lot of experiences, trying out new stuff and at the same time constantly looking for better alternatives.</p>\n<p>Throughout my adventures, I've had to make choices on tools, technologies and platforms I use to have my ideas come to life. Here they are:</p>\n<h3 id=\"ideation\"><a href=\"#ideation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Ideation</h3>\n<h5 id=\"-todoist\"><a href=\"#-todoist\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>* Todoist</h5>\n<p>Once an idea comes through my mind, no matter how unstructured it is, it usually comes with a default name to call it, this name can be changed later, but it helps me quickly add it to <a href=\"https://todoist.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Todoist</a> as a project to work on with a short description. I used to use Trello for this. Before coming up with <a href=\"https://clean-repos.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CleanRepos</a>, the idea came with a \"Repo Deleter\" tag.</p>\n<h5 id=\"-dropbox-paper\"><a href=\"#-dropbox-paper\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>* Dropbox Paper</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Paper</a> comes in really handy for pretty much everything these days - writing articles and also writing out thoughts. Once I am ready to dive deeper into an idea I have, I open a blank Paper page and start typing how I picture it to work, the flow, technologies and resources I'll need and also a basic idea of what pages should be available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"local-environment\"><a href=\"#local-environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Local Environment</h3>\n<p>For a long time, most of my career actually, I have just preferred to go the easy way out when it comes to setting up my local dev environment. I've tried a lot of tools as needed but I've mostly settled with using a stack. I am currently on Mac so I went with <a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MAMP</a> but now trying out <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Valet</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-control\"><a href=\"#version-control\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Version Control</h3>\n<p>Everybody uses Git... no? I used to use Bitbucket when there were no private repositories on <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a> but now, GitHub for everything. Public and private.</p>\n<h3 id=\"domain-names\"><a href=\"#domain-names\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Domain names</h3>\n<p>For a long time I used <a href=\"https://www.maddogdomains.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Maddogdomains</a> for my domain name management and I still have a couple domains there. But now, I have moved to <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Namecheap</a> and they are my go-to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hosting\"><a href=\"#hosting\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Hosting</h3>\n<p>I don't do much of shared hosting anymore. When I used to, I used <a href=\"https://www.qservers.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">QServers</a> and <a href=\"https://gigalayer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gigalayer</a> for clients. Moved to Azure because of BizSpark benefits but that's exhausted now. I use <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Heroku</a> (free) for my quick deployments and then <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DigitalOcean</a> (paid) when needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"platforms-ive-built-for\"><a href=\"#platforms-ive-built-for\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Platforms I've built for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Web</li>\n<li>Windows</li>\n<li>Android</li>\n<li>iOS</li>\n<li>FirefoxOS</li>\n<li>Windows Phone</li>\n<li>WordPress Plugin</li>\n<li>Browser extension - Chrome &#x26; Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll continue to update these with different sections as I come across them and if you need me to clarify any section especially those not mentioned here, feel free to drop a comment.</p>\n","cover_image":null}},"context":{}}
