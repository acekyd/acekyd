In this talk, I highlighted most especially that regardless of public noise, the people you've worked or interacted with would continue to have an impact on your career growth and being able to speak for you. I shared this talk recently on YouTube.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\">\n    <div style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;\">\n        <div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 25px; height: 0;\">\n            <iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BC_P6oAZ1qg\"\n                allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen>\n            </iframe>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>Secondly, a while back, Prosper wrote an article about <a href=\"https://dev.to/unicodeveloper/who-is-speaking-on-your-behalf-2c5e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Who is speaking on your behalf?</a> where he also highlighted the importance of other people being able to weigh in to have an impact on your career.</p>\n<p>Finally, I recently watched the Netflix special called Inventing Anna, and as I did, I wondered what it'd be like if someone that was legit was actually able to wield the social space with such power. </p>\n<p>I had no idea I was already in one of those.</p>\n<p>This story started for me when I noticed a profile that started popping up on my timeline that was engaging with my mutuals. I was fascinated because how have I never met or heard of this person that somehow is friends with all of my mutuals. Took a look and the profile was pretty good. </p>\n<p>I joined a Twitter space one time where people were shooting friendship shots and I seized the opportunity to satisfy my curiousity. We had a Google meets chat where I explained how my curiousity led me to want to know about him. In contrast to others, I did not smell any BS nor did I ask any probing questions. </p>\n<p>I was absolutely shook when I heard the news on social media and the reason I'm writing this is to point out how the people close to him, whose social capital he leveraged, provided a stamp of approval for him without realizing it. When they started picking up this red flags however, they stepped back because they didn't want to be seen as a hater but everyone else was still buying it. </p>\n<p>The whole purpose of this article is to highlight how this image laundering happened and how we can prevent it going forward. Our community is moving towards even more transparency and people who have established a certain level of social capital, have to understand that they indirectly endorse people that seem associated with them as well. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, they also have to take the social responsibility of pointing it out as early as possible despite how tricky it may look. </p>\n","cover_image":null}},"context":{}}
