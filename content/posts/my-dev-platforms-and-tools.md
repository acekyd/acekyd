I find building to be fun and also happens to be the best way I learn. This involves a lot of experiences, trying out new stuff and at the same time constantly looking for better alternatives.

Throughout my adventures, I've had to make choices on tools, technologies and platforms I use to have my ideas come to life. Here they are:

### Ideation
##### * Todoist
Once an idea comes through my mind, no matter how unstructured it is, it usually comes with a default name to call it, this name can be changed later, but it helps me quickly add it to Todoist as a project to work on with a short description. I used to use Trello for this.

##### * Dropbox Paper

Paper comes in really handy for pretty much everything these days


### Local Environment


### Version Control

### Domain names

### Hosting


### Emails
