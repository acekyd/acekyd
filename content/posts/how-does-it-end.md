description: Many things come in the way of getting things done - most especially overthinking.

Many times in my life I’ve overthought projects simply because I keep thinking of how they’d have to end. Thinking about the cost before the outcome. 

I’m a huge advocate of the journey is the prize, not the destination; but I can’t explain how sometimes in the pursuit of perfection and excellence, I refuse to start because I dread the consistency it requires and I’m haunted by the idea of said things ending as a result. 

I want to start a podcast, but damn! Does this mean I have to be available every Thursday for the rest of my life to make a new episode? 😭

But like the visionary Vision said, "**a thing isn’t beautiful because it lasts.**" 

And what’s crazy is, the best things have happened when I don’t overthink what it’s ending is supposed to be like. 

And this is a sign for me, and for you to embark on that adventure even when the next step or lifespan of it is still unknown.
