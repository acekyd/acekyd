Technical writing is any form of writing that helps break down technical tools, practices, opinions and ideas. It has rapidly become a valuable skill at all levels for anyone in a tech related career, developers and even designers.

I strongly believe everyone regardless of their skill level should embrace the opportunity of writing about what they are learning, opinions and even ideas they might find difficult to implement. It's a great way to not only grow an audience and a network, but also a platform to put yourself out there and showcase your knowledge.

As you venture into technical writing however, regardless of the complexity of your writing, here are a couple things you should keep in mind and attempt to get used to them as much as possible.

* Capitalizing your I pronoun
* Capitalizing brand names
* Syntax highlighting and formatting on code as much as possible
* Sentence case on title except on brand names
* Use correct punctuation as much as possible.
* Keep an end goal, what do you want the audience to achieve at the end of the article
* Add link for more references
* Keep your english simple
* Review your code like a prospective reader before publishing.
