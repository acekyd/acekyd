![Laravel Telescope](https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/blog-images-backup/1*ya66uWi8Ug21w5CLpIOvgA.png?zoom=2&resize=730%2C125&ssl=1)

When building web applications, it is almost impossible to avoid encountering bugs. This could range from a typo to a forgotten semicolon or an undefined function. But most importantly, you want to have an idea of everything going on in your application, how and when they happen. Having access to this information gives you a lot more control in narrowing down bugs and identifying opportunities to improve your application.

Laravel Telescope gives you exactly this power. It’s an amazing debugging assistant recently introduced in Laravel, that makes development a breeze with tools that allow you to not only monitor and debug various aspects of your application, but also have access to a wide range of information that you’d normally not have direct access to.

Laravel Telescope provides insights into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, notifications, cache and a lot more. It also shows how different parts of your application work together. You can find out which pages are working right and which queries were run when a request was made to a certain page.

In this article, we will be covering the amazing features of Telescope, how to set it up and what it can do for you.
