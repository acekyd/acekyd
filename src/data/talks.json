As more single page frontend applications are being built, there is even more reliance on an API to power the logic of the entire application. <br /><br /> This talk would cover the common practices, guidelines and tips to building a REST API that can be secure and easily accessible for Single Page Applications. We'd be going over using the right status codes, structure of endpoints and much more."
